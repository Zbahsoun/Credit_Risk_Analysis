# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the project

For this project, we will use supervised machine learning algorithms to predict credit risk to be able to provide a more reliable loan experience, and to help identify good candidate for loans. We will be cleaning the data and then splitting it into training and testing data, after implementing these algorithms we will evaluate their performance. 

## Results

Below are the learning machine models used and their findings.

### Naive Random Oversampling
